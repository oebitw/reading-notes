# Growth Mindset
Day by day we meet new people in our life some people view challanges as opportunites, understand faliure as an opportunity to grow, they always work to train their brains by learning and building new skills.
On the other hand we also met alot of people who avoid challanges, they understand faliure as a limit for the ability and they give up easily.
What is the difference between the two kinds of people?
## People with growth mindset.

It's Obvious from the title. the first group of people they have a **growth mindset**.
They love to **learn**, they are always **hungry for challanges** and you will never find them hiding in their **comfort zone**.

## People with fixed mindset.

As they say a picture talks more than words, this picture shows the mindset of people on the other side.
## How to keep yourself in a growth mindset ?

1. Learn from your mistakes, and never give up.
when someone asked elon musk when he failed for the third time in launching space x rocket after six years of hard working, and he was so close to broke and lose more than 100 million dollars.
Elon said: it's either to achieve it or to die. this is the soul we have to grow to succed in life.

2. Grow your skills and don't be afraid of failure.

The education system in schools and universities only rewards people with less faliures, people who do less mistakes in exams and assignments. From the first day we were trained to be afraid of doing miskates. This is not life.


If you lock your self in the comfort zone you will minimize your chances to fail, However you won't ever live a life with no faliures if you take the success path, life will hit you day by day until you reach your goals. 
It's okay to fail, but always take this faliures as lessons, and learn from other people falires as well if you really want to climb the ladder of success.

3. Open your mind and listen for other people constructive criticism.

On of the important skills you have to master is self-awarness.
Self-awarness is a powerful skill that will make you succefull and it will help you to keep yourself in a growth mindset.

One of the best ways to be self aware, is by knowing how other people see you, and it's achieved by listening to the constructive criticism you will face in your life.
