# CSS Lay Outs:

### Position Property

we use the position property to specify the type of positioning method used for any element in our code.
There are five different position values:
* static

Static is the default setting for the HTML elements, and they are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties they are always always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.
* relative

Here the element is positioned relative to its normal position.
* fixed

fixed elements always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
* absolute
* sticky

### Fixed width vs liquid layouts.

* Fixed-Width Layouts:  are layouts where the width of the entire page is set with a specific numerical value.

* Liquid Layouts: These are layouts where the width of the entire page is flexible depending on how wide the viewer's browser is.
