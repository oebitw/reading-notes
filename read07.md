# HTML Tables, Object-Oriented Programming

## HTML Tables

### How to create HTML tables
To create a table we use:

Table tag: ` <table></table>`

We create a  head for the table using:

`<th> </th>`

we create a row for the table using:

`<tr> </tr>`

and we insert data to the table using:

`<td> </td>`

so basically we create tables as the following:

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Omar</td>
    <td>Ewies</td>
    <td>26</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>khaled</td>
    <td>ahmad</td>
    <td>30</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

## Object-Oriented Programming

Functions help us to aggregate a group of statements to represent a specific task, functions might recieve parameters and ot also can return a value.

we define objects by giving them variables (properties) and functions (methods) as we did in lab06.

There are customized objects like the ones we create and define the properties and create functions for it, and there are built in objects in JS like the Number object, Math object and many other objects, the book organized the built in objects in three main categories:
* BROWSER OBJECT MODEL
* DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
* GLOBAL JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS

we can combine arrays and objects, to clear up the point, we want to know that arrays can store a series of objects and also objects can hold objects as values for their properties.
