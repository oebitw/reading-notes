# Audio, Video, Images, and practical Information

## Images

After adding an img in HTML
 `<img src="/img.path" alt="">` we can design the image by applying css codes to it.
 We can specify the dimensions of the images by giving them a width and height. width and height might be in pixels in % and other parameters.

We can also manipulate the images alignment, we can aligned the pictures vertically and horizontally. 

Moreover we can add images as a background for the html elements. for example we can select a paragraph and add an image as a background for it.

Sometimes if we have a lot of images on the webpage, it will load slowly specially if the images size very large. to solve this issue we can reduce the number of images the browser have to load by creating image sprites.




## Practical Information

SEO is one of the most important marketing tools in the digital marketing, SEO makes your website appear in the first searching page and will make users reach your website easily.

To track the users statistics like how many users entered the website, which webpage has the most bouncing rate, what is the bouncing rate for the website in general, and a lot of very important data. you track all this data using google analytics.

All the websites on the the internet has a domain name and web hosting.

The domain name it's like the address for the website and the host it's where all the website data stored.
We can store and transfer the website files and data from the computer to the web server using ftp programs.

Moreover there are different platforms on the web that is built to make the process of developing website easier and not to start building the website from zero. 
We call this platforms ( content management system ) like wordpress, shopify, magneto and many other platforms.


## Audio and Video

Adding audios and videos to the websites are almost the same.

To add a video to a website we will build it's structure using html and then customize it as we want using css and JS, the same goes to audios.

The html tags and code that allow us to have a video on the website is as the following:

```
<video controls>
  <source src="ASAC.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="ASAC.webm" type="video/webm">
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>
```

the controls attribute  makes buttons for controlling the video to play it pause it and other controlling buttons. we also can customize these buttons and build them using js by using `addEventListener` and make a function for each button.
