On the other hand, **Code editors** are specifically built to edit codes. They provide us with various features like:

1. code completion.
2. syntax highlighting.
3. variety of themes selections.
4. Installing extensions.

Code editors are mostly integrated with the IDE (Integrated Development Environment). There are few standalone code editors like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) & [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) .
