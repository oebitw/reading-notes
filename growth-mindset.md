# Growth Mindset
Day by day we meet new people in our life some people view challanges as opportunites, understand faliure as an opportunity to grow, they always work to train their brains by learning and building new skills.
On the other hand we also met alot of people who avoid challanges, they understand faliure as a limit for the ability and they give up easily.
What is the difference between the two kind of people?
## People with growth mindset.

It's Obvious from the title. the first group of people they have a growth mindset.
They love to learn, they are always hungry for challanges and you will never find them hiding in their comfort zone.

 Elon said: it's either to achieve it or to die. this is the soul we have to grow to succed in life.
