# Forms and Events.
## Forms

We use forms to collect data from the website users, we collect the form using the `<form>` element.

the information that we receive from the users by the form sent in name and value pair.

the info entered in the form will be directed to the server.

with the new technologies of HTML5 users now can fill forms in a very easy way.

As all the elements in HTML, we can design the `<form>` element using CSS.
It's better to make the forms controls design
vertically aligned using CSS, it will be easier for the users to use the forms in this case.


## Events

The browsers indicate if something happened on the website because of the events. So when a customer click on a button this will be an event and the browser will be notified about it to take the action.

When an event occurs, for example a user clicked on a button this will trigger a JS functions and other codes to make an action and the website be interactive with the user.
